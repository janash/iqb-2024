You can read more in the [original publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3041641/), or in the [Vinardo paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4865195/)\n",

The `ad4` score requires the definition of a flexible receptor, so it won't work with the PDBQT we have prepared. If you are interested in flexible docking, see [the tutorial from AutoDock Vina](https://autodock-vina.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docking_flexible.html). <strong>If you try to use the `ad4` scoring function on a receptor that was not prepared to be a flexible receptor, your notebook kernel will crash.</strong>\n",

Exhaustiveness also corresponds to the amount of computational effort used during a docking experiment. The default exhaustiveness value is 8; increasing this to 32 will give a more consistent docking result. \n",
