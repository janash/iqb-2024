    "* How can I manipulate and create new molecules from an existing molecule?\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Objectives</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "* To understand the utility of the different Python libraries utilized in this notebook\n",
    "* To explain the features of SMILES strings and how they are used to communicate chemical structures to computers\n",

    "In this notebook, we load an \"ideal\" structure for a ligand obtained in the [EC_class_ligands_search](EC_class_ligands_search.ipynb) notebook by pulling coordinates from the PDB and then we manipulate it using RDKit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken here is manual and hands on. We will pick atoms of interest visually, then morph atomic numbers in order to change a carbon atom into a nitrogen atom, and then add a methyl group by changing a hydrogen atom into a carbon atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "By loading our molecule from an ideal structure with 3D coordinates, we can ensure that we're already near a \"good structure\" for our manipulated molecules and our geometry optimization will be more likely to succeed.\n",
